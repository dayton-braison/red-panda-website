        <h3>History</h3>    
        <p>Red pandas are a mammal species native to southwestern China and eastern Himalayas.</p>

        <p>The red panda has long, soft reddish-brown fur on the upper parts, blackish fur on the lower parts, and a light face with tear markings and white badges similar to those of a raccoon.  Its skull is roundish with medium-sized upright ears, its nose is black, and its eyes are blackish.  The fur on the panda's body serves as thermal insulation on snow-covered or icy surfaces and conceals scent glands.  The red panda is territorial; it is solitary except during mating season.  It is generally quiet except for some twittering, tweeting, and whistling communication sounds.

        Red pandas are excellent climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries. In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, flowers, maple and mulberry leaves, and bark and fruits of maple, beech, and mulberry.  The red panda is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008 because the global population is estimated at about 10,000 individuals.

        <h3>Panda Panda!!!</h3>
        <p>Red pandas are able to reproduce at around 18 months of age, and are fully mature at two to three years. Adults rarely interact in the wild except to mate. Both sexes may mate with more than one partner during the mating season from mid-January to early March.

        After birth, the mother cleans the cubs, and can then recognize each by their smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% of her time with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. A red panda's lifespan ranges between eight and 10 years, but individuals have been known to reach 15 years.
